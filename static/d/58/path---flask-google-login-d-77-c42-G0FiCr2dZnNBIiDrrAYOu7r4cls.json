If you wish to skip ahead to the example Flask app click <a href=\"#flask\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://oauth.net/2/\">OAuth 2</a> is a specification or standard which can enable applications to obtain (limited) access to data on another service such as Google, Facebook or Spotify for example. Services may authorize access to different levels of data ranging from basic account information all the way to wanting access to your emails (<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides/\">Gmail API</a>). Specifically, OAuth 2 is an authorization framework. It does not specify exactly how services should handle authentication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://openid.net/connect/\">OpenID Connect</a> is an identity layer built on top of OAuth 2. OpenID Connect is helpful because it defines some extra steps to the OAuth 2 flow which make federated authentication possible. One of the main steps is the returning of an <code class=\"language-text\">id_token</code> from the authorization server. This token is usually a JSON Web Token (<a href=\"https://jwt.io/\">JWT</a>) which serializes various data such as <code class=\"language-text\">iss</code> (issuer) and <code class=\"language-text\">iat</code> (issued at). They can include additional data. For example, Google’s id_tokens do include email addresses (assuming ‘email’ is part of the scope you specified when initiating the request).</p>\n<p>For our example application we will be using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect\">Google</a> as an authentication provider. Their implementation conforms to OpenID connect.</p>\n<h3>[#flask] The Example Application</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"Signing in with a Google Account with your Flask application","date":"January 19, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/flask-google-login/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello"}},"next":null}}
